# Patatap
A tiny custom cloneable project of  https://patatap.com/, by using *Paper.js* and *Holwer.js*.

Inspired by the original project, [Patatap](https://patatap.com/),  this project is a simple version of it.  You can play any keyboard key(a - z) to play different sound and "compose" a sweet song only belongs to yourself :)

However, currently it can only showcase some circles. I'll update it with various shape further.

*Paper.js* - Handle the stuff in canvas, such as circle, animation and text.

*Howler.js* - Manage the audio sources and play them.
